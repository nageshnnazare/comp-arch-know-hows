## Overview

Computer architecture is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. It deals with the functional behavior of computer systems as seen by the programmer, including the instruction set, the number of bits used for data representation, addressing modes, and memory organization.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Organization**: Hardware implementation details
- **Architecture**: Attributes visible to the programmer
- **Design**: How components are interconnected
